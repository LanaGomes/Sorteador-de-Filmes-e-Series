# Sorteador-de-Filmes-e-Series
Small project to study basic Javascript that I'm learning

The goal is to be able to pick up a movie or series randomly by pressing the button "Sortear / Sortear novamente!".
Along the way I'm also trying new things in order to improve my learning process in javascript. Things like use functions, play a little with DOM and ways to solve simple problems.
